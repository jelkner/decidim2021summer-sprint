donated in support of Civic Participation. 

1. [Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/grant-opportunities/) 
	* Potential sectors to apply for: 3) Equitable Development; 4) Inclusive
Economies; 5) Internet Freedom
	* committed to giving to marginalized communities and at least 25% to 
"social justice strategies, such as advocacy, community organizing, and civic
engagement"
2. W. K. Kellog: 
	* mainly focused on children, so I don't think it quite fits what NOVA
Web wants to do. 
3. [Silicon Valley Community Foundation](http://www.siliconvalleycf.org) 
	* Potential areas to apply to: Regional Planning and Community 
Opportunity Fund
	* committed to giving to marginalized communities and at least 25% to 
"social justice strategies, such as advocacy, community organizing, and civic 
engagement"
4. [Carnegie Corporation of New York](https://www.carnegie.org/)
	* Potential area to apply to: Pathways to Citizenship and Civic
Integration
	* especially: 3) Citizenship and nonpartisan civic engagement: integrate
immigrants into the nationâ€™s civic and economic life;
5. The JPB Foundation:
	* povert, medical research, and environment focus - not very suitable
6. [Foundation to Promote Open Society](http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org)
	* great opportunity! Seems like they would be super interested in what
NOVA Web wants to do:
	* "support efforts to engage citizens not just in voting, but in 
ensuring that governments respond to the challenges of the day and the needs of 
all their people."
	* "support groups that monitor government action and promote 
transparency and accountability as a check on corruption and abuse in the 
democratic process."
