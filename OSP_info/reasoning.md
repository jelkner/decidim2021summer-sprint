# Why Does OSP Exist and What is Their Cause?

OSP exists because they believe that technology should be used to enhance
democracy and to increase access to particpation in democracy. They think that
civic-tech should be used to encourage civic participation and engagement, 
democracy, and government transparency. They believe that at the core of open
government is a cooperation between governments, citizens, and organizations; 
each with a different need or focus. The organizations often provide software to
the government to facilitate engagement, however their need is to increase 
profit and resources, making them more likely to provide proprietary software to
governments. OSP is concerned about this use of proprietary software
because of several potential dangers:
* lack of transparency: the government doesn't have access to the source code,
but the code is the result of technical and ideological choices of designers
* loss of sovereignty: a dataset can be published, but if it is from a 
non-auditable source there is potential for sabotage
* absence of collaboration: the tech is already out there and governments have
the same needs. But because it's proprietary, they aren't financing freely 
reusable public goods that could help other governments and citizens as well

Although open source democracy technology isn't as profitable for investors, it
profits citizens and democracy in the long run.
