# [The UIC Great Cities Institute](https://www.participatepbchicago.org/)

Chicago has 10 wards that are using participatory budgeting. They have $1.5 million dedicated to each ward to be put towards projects that match the needs of each wards' citizens. Open Source Politics trained and supported the UIC GCI for the past five months and helped create a strategy for mobilizing Decidim in each ward. OSP was of assistance there because each ward had to have a slightly different strategy because they contain different people with varying desires. The site for it is not launched yet, but anyone can still view their Decidim experimentation as well as how they are looking to separate processes and proposals by ward. There is also a focus on inclusion, as there are dozens of language options on the site to support Chicago's many cultures.
