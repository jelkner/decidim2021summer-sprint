Open Source Politics deployed Decidim for the NYC CEC with the intent of using it for participatory budgeting. The City of New York provided $100,000 to be allocated to various projects with the purpose of increasing youth engagement. OSP's role in the implementation of Decidim in New York was to provide training and hands-on assistance for eight months. This specific project was unique for OSP because they were being hired by a youth-led group that has a focus on inclusion and ease of use for a younger audience. Then, the agreed upon projects to use their funds for is carried out by the teens of CEC themselves. Nobody is even able to participate outside the ages of 9 and 24, meaning it is exclusively for young New Yorkers.
