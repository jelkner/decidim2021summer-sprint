# [NYC Civic Engagement Commission](https://www.participate.nyc.gov/)

Open Source Politics deployed Decidim for the NYC CEC with the intent of using it for participatory budgeting. The City of New York
provided $100,000 to be allocated to various projects with the purpose of increasing youth engagement. OSP's role in the implementat
ion of Decidim in New York was to provide training and hands-on assistance for eight months. This specific project was unique for OS
P because they were being hired by a youth-led group that has a focus on inclusion and ease of use for a younger audience. Then, the
 agreed upon projects to use their funds for is carried out by the teens of CEC themselves. Nobody is even able to participate outsi
de the ages of 9 and 24, meaning it is exclusively for young New Yorkers. 


# [Pheonix Union High School District] (https://opensourcepolitics.eu/project/budget-participatif-redesigning-safeschools-pxu/)

Open Source Politics deployed Decidim for the Pheonix union district high schools following the "defund the police movement".
 Through Decidim, the district of Pheonix union, Arizona has been allocated a participatory budget of 2 million dollars coming directly from the school police fund.

There have been three separate particpatory budgets that have been created for elementary school, middle school, and high school.

Parents, students, and school staff members are now responsible for dividing that budget up in order to ensure a safer school and education environment.

This project was a joint collaboration between Open Source Politics and an American organization, called Pipeline to Power.
