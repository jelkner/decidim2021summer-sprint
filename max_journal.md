# Max's Summer Prime Program Journal
**On the first day,** we spent the majority of the time setting up our workspace and connecting to the Internet at CoworkCafe. I did some tutorials with Unix and Vim to help prepare to use them on the following days. Worked from 7:30-1:30.  

**On the second day,** we had a virtual field trip with the Prime Program to be able to speak to people currently in the STEM field in Northern Virginia. The majority of the Zoom call was spent trying to sell the world of engineering to us viewers.  

**On the third day,** we hit the ground running. First, we tested and became fmailiar with BBB in preparation for our video conference with Colombene Gorton this afternoon. We communicated this with her through Zulip. Then, we cloned the git repository that we are working on to ur computers. After that, we each added our own journals to the repository and made commits for each of them. Today, we have had to put our practice with Git and Vim to use. We configured our ssh so that we can enter without a password and disabled passwords entirely. We had our conference call with Colombene, where we learned about User Experience and the necessity of UX in all sorts of projects. Unfortunately, there may have been an issue with the recording, so that is yet to be concluded. We then discussed our plan for installing Decidim tomorrow, when I accidentally found Jeff's blog post about the installation process that we needed.  

**On the fourth day,** we began the day beginning the installation process for Decidim. It is somewhat unclear how long this process will last, but it definitely will not be a short amount of time. Adding to the lengthy process, we were unaware of the fact that the recommended version of Ruby to download was outdated and caused and error during the Decidim installation. We seem to be getting stuck at the end as we attempt to install Passenger. The failed install of Passenger brought up several other issues which made us eventually realize that we probably have to completely restart with Ubuntu instead of Debian 10. While our Decidim installation process is somewhat on hold, we have been researching various other implementations of Decidim. I contacted the Participatory Budgeting Project in New York City to try to learn more and I am eager for a response. We had to essentially restart twice now, so the responsibility of being the one installing everything is no longer on my hands. Unlikely that the installation process will be done in the next 20 minutes, but I suppose there is optimism for next week.  

**On the fifth day,** Louis had already finished the Decidim installation for us, as we likely could have finished if it were not for some amount of miscommunication. We are currently awaiting admin access to Decidim Dogfood, but Hashim seems to have received the proper instruction on how to do that exactly. Meanwhile, I've spent more time researching and contacting other implementations of Decidim around the world. Given that our original plan for the day has been somewhat delayed, we are now mostly just waiting around and doing basic busy-work for the time being.
