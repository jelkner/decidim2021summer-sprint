# Max's Summer Prime Program Journal
**On the first day,** we spent the majority of the time setting up our workspace and connecting to the Internet at CoworkCafe. I did some tutorials with Unix and Vim to help prepare to use them on the following days. Worked from 7:30-1:30.  

**On the second day,** we had a virtual field trip with the Prime Program to be able to speak to people currently in the STEM field in Northern Virginia. The majority of the Zoom call was spent trying to sell the world of engineering to us viewers.  

**On the third day,** we hit the ground running. First, we tested and became fmailiar with BBB in preparation for our video conference with Colombene Gorton this afternoon. We communicated this with her through Zulip. Then, we cloned the git repository that we are working on to ur computers. After that, we each added our own journals to the repository and made commits for each of them. Today, we have had to put our practice with Git and Vim to use. We configured our ssh so that we can enter without a password and disabled passwords entirely. We had our conference call with Colombene, where we learned about User Experience and the necessity of UX in all sorts of projects. Unfortunately, there may have been an issue with the recording, so that is yet to be concluded. We then discussed our plan for installing Decidim tomorrow, when I accidentally found Jeff's blog post about the installation process that we needed.  

**On the fourth day,** we began the day beginning the installation process for Decidim. It is somewhat unclear how long this process will last, but it definitely will not be a short amount of time. Adding to the lengthy process, we were unaware of the fact that the recommended version of Ruby to download was outdated and caused and error during the Decidim installation. We seem to be getting stuck at the end as we attempt to install Passenger. The failed install of Passenger brought up several other issues which made us eventually realize that we probably have to completely restart with Ubuntu instead of Debian 10. While our Decidim installation process is somewhat on hold, we have been researching various other implementations of Decidim. I contacted the Participatory Budgeting Project in New York City to try to learn more and I am eager for a response. We had to essentially restart twice now, so the responsibility of being the one installing everything is no longer on my hands. Unlikely that the installation process will be done in the next 20 minutes, but I suppose there is optimism for next week.  

**On the fifth day,** Louis had already finished the Decidim installation for us, as we likely could have finished if it were not for some amount of miscommunication. We are currently awaiting admin access to Decidim Dogfood, but Hashim seems to have received the proper instruction on how to do that exactly. Meanwhile, I've spent more time researching and contacting other implementations of Decidim around the world. Given that our original plan for the day has been somewhat delayed, we are now mostly just waiting around and doing basic busy-work for the time being. We just got admin access to Decidim Dogfood and it is time to start playing with it. This period of time to investigate Decidim's capabilities is what this internship's goal is, so I'm ready to take this seriously and hit the ground running. I have created a process with an introduction, a survey, and a proposal. However, I seem to keep running into an issue with the proposal where I get an error message about a problem with the server each time I try to open it. A search on Google tells me that Decidim may need to be updated, but it was only installed yesterday. Was the latest version not installed when Louis did it yesterday? If not, did Louis install an older version on purpose? What issues would be caused by getting the latest update? These are all questions I hope I can find the answers to at some point, but we only have about an hour left, so I plan to keep experimenting with other aspects of the process for now. It seems that my Google searching brought me to the wrong answer because Ivy solved my problem! I now have a working proposal as well as options to vote on budgeting for that proposal. The UI for this site is honestly really appealing, so I could totally imagine something like this being used on a large scale, but first we need to perfect this.  

**On the sixth day,** things truly started off with a bang! I checked my NOVA Web Development inbox to see that a representative from FundAction (one of the companies I had reached out to earlier) had responded! Given that we are practicing participatory governance, I figured this would be a perfect use of Decidim to decide how we want to repond to FundAction. First, we gave our presentation of our progress from yesterday to Jeff, which he was very impressed by. Then, I got right to work creating a process for us to choose our method and plan of communication with this representative. One aspect that I wish I could get to work, but cannot seem to find the solution to is allowing participants to create their own proposals. Luckily, this does not hold back the process for FundAction Communication, but it would certainly be nice to utilize.
