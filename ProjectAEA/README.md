# Project Proposal: Using Decidim in a Union Organizing Drive

## Background

In March, 2020, Virginia lawmakers
[ended the ban on public sector collective bargaining](https://apnews.com/article/6559ad8943dd4d1c22e519d27530c2f0)
for local governments that wanted to engage in the practice. The new
legislation took effect on May 1, 2021. On Saturday, July 17th, the Arlington
County Board [revised the County ordance](https://arlington.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&event_id=1660&meta_id=204481)
to [authorize collective bargaining for county employees](https://www.arlnow.com/2021/07/19/board-authorizes-collective-bargaining-for-county-workers-higher-wages-for-contractors/).

In a [document on collective bargaining](https://arlington.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=3951&meta_id=204770) hosted on the County website, the
following process is pressented in the final slide titled "Next Steps":

1. Ordinance Adopted
2. Organizing Campaign
3. Petition for Certification
4. Election Campaign
5. Election

The process then divides into two paths: *Union Not Elected*, ending the
process, or *Union Elected*, leading to:

6. Bargaining Begins 


## AEA and the Arlington School Board

The [Arlington Education Association](https://aeava.org/) is the
[local affiliate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_union) of the
[National Education Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Education_Association), the largest union in the United States. NEA locals are
affiliated with state organizations, which are in turn members of the national
union. In AEA's case, the state affiliate is the
[Virginia Education Association](https://www.veanea.org/).

With the passage of [House Bill 582](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1209&201+ful+CHAP1209) and [Senate Bill 939](https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?201+ful+CHAP1276&201+ful+CHAP1276) in the 2020
legislative session, and resulting amendment to the [Code of Virginia ยง
40.1-57.s](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title40.1/chapter4/article2.1/),
the previous ban on county governments from entering into collective bargaining
agreements with county workers has now been lifted, and VEA has made the
[Organize to Bargain (O2B)](https://www.veanea.org/o2b/) the central focus of
its efforts for the next two years.

At the time of this writing, the lead message on the
[VEA website](https://www.veanea.org/) reads, "Contract Negotiations: A Win for
Our Students, Educators, and Schools".
