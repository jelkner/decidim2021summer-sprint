# Four Questions About the AEA Project

1. What is your project?

   In brief, it is to use [Decidim](https://decidim.org/) as a resource in
   the organizing campaign, petition for certification, election campaign,
   and perhaps even the election steps as presented in
   [Collective Bargaining](https://arlington.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=2&clip_id=3951&meta_id=204770).

2. How will your project benefit from participatory democracy?

   As Jane McAlevey lays out in [A Collective Bargain: Unions, Organizing, and
   the Fight for Democracy](https://janemcalevey.com/book/a-collective-bargain-unions-organizing-and-the-fight-for-democracy/),
   "[f]or decades, intractable social and economic problems have been eating
   away at the social and political fabric of the United States. There is a
   single, obvious weapon whose effectiveness has been proven repeatedly
   throughout US history: unions."

   To be effective in the campaign for union representation and collective
   bargaining for Arlington Public School workers, the campaign process itself
   must embody the very participatory democracy we seek for the larger
   society in which it exists.

3. What is your projectâ€™s timeline?

   The campaign should begin in ernest when the new school year begins at the
   end of August and continue until union representaton and collective
   bargaining are won.

4. How many people are involved in the project?

   The 1900+ members of the Arlington Education Association.
