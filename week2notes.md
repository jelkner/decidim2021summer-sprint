# Notes for Week 2: July 5 to July 11, 2021

## Tuesday, July 6th

The first day of PRIME was spent setting up our work environments, including
connecting to the wifi at [Cowork Cafe](https://coworkcafe.com/), installing
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and purchasing a lock that would
fit in the Cowork Cafe lockers.

The rest of the time Ivy, Karim, Marian and Max spent doing a crash course
on the [Unix CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and
starting to learn [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor).

They have a "field trip" tomorrow, and Thursday we will dive into git and
begin our investigation and documentation of [Decidim](https://decidim.org/).
