# Notes for Week 2: July 5 to July 11, 2021


## Friday, July 9th

We are on the last day of the first week of our four week
[PRIME](https://careercenter.apsva.us/prime/) internship. This is actually
the short week, since Monday was a holiday. We will meet four days instead
of three for the remaining weeks.

The goals week were to:

1. Set up our work environment. I already wrote about what we needed to
   do on the first day to get connectivity and begin to learn the
   *survival skills* which will be needed to deploy and configure
   [Decidim](https://decidim.org/).

1. Finish our crash course in the
   [Unix CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface),
   [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\)), and
   [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). As stated on the introductory
   web page, PRIME is a program for "students who have been identified for
   gifted services". Our experience this week is a confirmation of that
   description.  Ivy, Karim, Marian and Max were ablt to absorb whatever I
   threw at them as fast as I could throw it. During the regular school year
   it takes me three weeks to a month to get my students to develop usable
   skills with the CLI, vim, and git, where here we did it in a day and a half,
   with productive level mastery in that time. 

1. Set up the virtual machine on which our Decidim instance will run, give
   each of us [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) access, and begin to
   think about what needed to be done to deply Decidim.

1. Deploy Decidim.

At the time I am writing this on Friday morning, all but the last of these
goals have been met.
       
Yesterday afternoon [Colombene gave a presentation](https://meetings.agaric.coop/playback/presentation/2.3/87fec7a20cb3466bf385b02e6d5510d76302e1f7-1625747593616)
on [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience). I wasn't present
during the presentation, but I just finished listening to it now.

Having Colombene join NOVA Web Development is a game changer for us, as her
presentation makes abundantly clear. If we are going to offer Decidim support
as part of our business plan, success will depend overwhelmingly on our ability
to deeply understand the *user experience* related to its use, and to be able
to make that user experience as engaging as possible. If we fail to do that,
users will simply not want to use it, and any hope of it being and effective
tool for
[participatory democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_democracy)
and
[participatory economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participatory_economics)
will be lost.

The plutocrats who run our country are able to make us do the the work of
planning, building, and maintaining the means of social reproduction by
threating to withhold work, the means of social existance in our system, from
us if we fail to do their bidding. A democratic system will have no such
coercive power, and will instead have to rely on engaging our higher
motivations to inspire us to do the work that needs to be done. Success with
Decidim will mean learning how to make using it an experience that engages
these higher motivations.

On Monday I'll report on how our interns did with setting up a running
instance of Decidim. If they can't accomplish that today, I'll need to ask
for help from the NOVA Web development team to finish the task, so that we
are ready to begin exploring its use on Monday.


## Tuesday, July 6th

The first day of PRIME was spent setting up our work environments, including
connecting to the wifi at [Cowork Cafe](https://coworkcafe.com/), installing
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and purchasing a lock that would
fit in the Cowork Cafe lockers.

The rest of the time Ivy, Karim, Marian and Max spent doing a crash course
on the [Unix CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and
starting to learn [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\)).

They have a "field trip" tomorrow, and Thursday we will dive into git and
begin our investigation and documentation of [Decidim](https://decidim.org/).
