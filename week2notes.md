# Notes for Week 2: July 5 to July 11, 2021


## Friday, July 9th

We are on the last day of the first week of our four week
[PRIME](https://careercenter.apsva.us/prime/) internship. This is actually
the short week, since Monday was a holiday. We will meet four days instead
of three for the remaining weeks.

The goals week were to:

1. Set up our work environment. I already wrote about what we needed to
   do on the first day to get connectivity and begin to learn the
   *survival skills* which will be needed to deploy and configure
   [Decidim](https://decidim.org/).

1. Finish our crash course in the
   [Unix CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface),
   [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\)), and
   [git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). As stated on the introductory
   web page, PRIME is a program for "students who have been identified for
   gifted services". Our experience this week is a confirmation of that
   description.  Ivy, Karim, Marian and Max were ablt to absorb whatever I
   threw at them as fast as I could throw it. During the regular school year
   it takes me three weeks to a month to get my students to develop usable
   skills with the CLI, vim, and git, where here we did it in a day and a half,
   with productive level mastery in that time. 

1. Set up the virtual machine on which our Decidim instance will run, give
   each of us [sudo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo) access, and begin to
   think about what needed to be done to deply Decidim.

1. Deploy Decidim.

At the time I am writing this on Friday morning, all but the last of these
goals have been met.
       
Yesterday afternoon [Colombene gave a presentation](https://meetings.agaric.coop/playback/presentation/2.3/87fec7a20cb3466bf385b02e6d5510d76302e1f7-1625747593616)
on [UX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience). I wasn't present
during the presentation, but I just finished listening to it now.


## Tuesday, July 6th

The first day of PRIME was spent setting up our work environments, including
connecting to the wifi at [Cowork Cafe](https://coworkcafe.com/), installing
[git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git), and purchasing a lock that would
fit in the Cowork Cafe lockers.

The rest of the time Ivy, Karim, Marian and Max spent doing a crash course
on the [Unix CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) and
starting to learn [vim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_\(text_editor\)).

They have a "field trip" tomorrow, and Thursday we will dive into git and
begin our investigation and documentation of [Decidim](https://decidim.org/).
