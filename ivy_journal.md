# Ivy's Summer PRIME Program Journal

## Tuesday, July 6

Our first day started off slowly, with difficulties connecting to CoworkCafe's
WiFi. Although WiFi difficulties took up a large chunk of the day, I was able
to complete a vim tutorial and a
[Unix tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html). I also
began reading up on
[Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).

The second day of the internship had a much smoother start. There were no
difficulties connecting to WiFi or getting online. We began today with learning
Git. Our first step was the SSH key. We learned the background of it, why it's
better than a password, and how to generate and upload it to GitHub. Next, we
cloned the repository and created Markdown journals. We applied what we learned
about Vim on Tuesday to edit these journals. Next, we learned how to add,
commit, push and pull to make sure that our work is saved and uploaded into the
repo. I learned about merges, and how merge conflicts can occur. Finally, we
applied this to push our journals and pull our colleagues' journals. Towards the
afternoon, we met Colombene. She introduced us to UX, or User Experience. I 
think my main takeaway from that was there are a lot of different factors to 
juggle when looking at software or products from a UX point of view. We finished
off the day by making a plan to install Decidim on Friday.

## Friday, July 9

We began today by having a morning meeting discussing our reasons for doing 
PRIME and what we hope to gain from this experience. Then, we reviewed our goals
for the day, which included installing Decidim. After discussion with Jeff and
then amongst us interns, we decided to follow the helpful instructions sent by 
Louis. There were some roadblocks along the way, but we were able to resolve 
them. For example, installing Ruby and some of the other software required a git
clone. However, we received an error message that 'git' wasn't recognized by the
program. We problem solved this by looking up how to install git, and then 
executing that command. After resolving this and continuing forth, we ran into a
problem installing Passenger to connect Ruby with Nginx. Specifically, we got an
error of unmet dependencies. We found some tips online, but they didn't resolve
the problem. We contacted Louis for some help with it. It turns out, we needed
to use Ubuntu instead of Debian. So, we went through the lengthy process of
turning our home directories to tar and then putting it onto a new Ubuntu 
server. While this was running, we investigated more into Decidim. From the 
Decidim Docs, I learned the following information:
** Participatory Spaces ** | ** Participatory Components **
-------------------------- | -----------------------------
channels to participate through | mechanisms to enable interaction
processes, initiatives, consultations, and assemblies | meetings, pages, proposals, and surveys
