# Ivy's Summer PRIME Program Journal

## Tuesday, July 6
Our first day started off slowly, with difficulties connecting to CoworkCafe's WiFi. Although WiFi difficulties took up a large chunk of the day, I was able to complete a vim tutorial and a [Unix tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html). I also began reading up on [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).

## Thursday, July 8
The second day of the internship had a much smoother start. There were no difficulties connecting to WiFi or getting online. We began today with learning Git. Our first step was the SSH key. We learned the background of it, why it's better than a password, and how to generate and upload it to GitHub. Next, we cloned the repository and created Markdown journals. We applied what we learned about Vim on Tuesday to edit these journals. Next, we learned how to add, commit, push and pull to make sure that our work is saved and uploaded into the repo. I learned about merges, and how merge conflicts can occur. Finally, we applied this  to push our journals and pull our colleagues' journals.
