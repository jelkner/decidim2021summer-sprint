# Ivy's Summer PRIME Program Journal

## Tuesday, July 6
Our first day started off slowly, with difficulties connecting to CoworkCafe's WiFi. Although WiFi difficulties took up a large chunk of the day, I was able to complete a vim tutorial and a [Unix tutorial](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/index.html). I also began reading up on [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control).

The second day of the internship had a much smoother start. There were no difficulties connecting to WiFi or getting online.
