# Marian's PRIME Program Journal

Welcome to Marian's PRIME journal!

**July 8th**: This is my second day at PRIME. I learned how to create and save
a file using vim commands. I also had the chance to explore BigBlueButton and
how to use it. I am starting to learn vim because last year I have worked with
nano instead. It is similar to nano but different in some ways, I still have to
get used to it. I hope I can also log in to the sites more easily next time
because today I had to go to them using the links in the inbox. Today we set up
ssh keys and learned how to clone the decidim repository. I also have to get
used to the three git commands: git add, git commit, git push.  

**July 9th:** This is my third day at PRIME. Today we are going to try to install Decidim so that next week we can start working on the software. The instructions to install Decidim was on a Zulip post. I hope that we can successfully install Decidim soon!

**July 12:** Today I worked on the Dogfood website after being made an admin. I made a process about the air conditioning in the cafe. There are also proposals and surveys that can be created on a process about the topic, and the process can be published when it's ready.

**July 13:** Today I worked on Dogfood and updated the process I made yesterday. I included a survey for mine and added more description to it. Next, I'm going to publish it so that the process is visible to others. This morning, we had a meeting about what we have done yesterday. The meeting took place in the freezer room when we first arrived to the cafe. After some technical difficulties, the computer connected to the television.

**July 15:** I am creating new components in Dogfood so that I can find out how each one works. The ones that I have tried so far are proposals, surveys, and blogs. I am still trying to figure out how exactly the website works and what it can do. Today we are going to have a meeting at 12:30 pm. Today I was added as an admin to the ustechworkerscoops.org website. We are planning on what topics to discuss on the July 19th meeting with FundAction. It is a company that uses Decidim to manage budgeting in Europe.

**July 16:** Today we tried to set up the Linux computers for the meeting that is occurring at 12:15 on Monday. BigBlueButton was used to set them up. They were connected to the television in the freezer room and both worked with sharing the screen. What didn't seem to work was the microphone in the second computer while in the meeting, and the first computer crashed. The ustechworkercoops website is being edited and proposals are being added so that the upcoming meetings are easier to plan out. To plan the meeting, we also had to remember that FundAction is ahead of EST by 5 hours and reserve the freezer room for that time.

**July 19:** Today the group is going to attend a meeting with FundAction at 11:15 am. It's going to be held in the freezer room and we'll use BigBlueButton to connect with the company. During the meeting, questions will be asked that come from the Ustechworkercoops website where they were planned out by the group. After it ends, we have another meeting at 12:00 pm. Tomorrow we are going to have another meeting at 9:55 with Open Source Politics. Their timezone is different than ours, so planning was a bit more difficult. They are 6 hours ahead of us. 

**July 20** Today the group is going to attend a meeting at 9:55 with Open Source Politics.

**July 22** Today I will be researching and learning more about Open Source Politics.

**July 23** Today I will be researching about grants that can be added to the company.

**July 24** I researched to find grants for the company.

**July 27** I researched to find grants.

**July 29** I looked for grants.

**July 30** I pasted the grant links into this document. I learned a lot from this internship, I am glad that I was could add onto my knowldge and learn about workplace skills that I will bring to my future jobs. Thank you for this amazing opportunity!
