# Marian's PRIME Program Journal

Welcome to Marian's PRIME journal!

**July 8th**: This is my second day at PRIME. I learned how to create and save
a file using vim commands. I also had the chance to explore BigBlueButton and
how to use it. I am starting to learn vim because last year I have worked with
nano instead. It is similar to nano but different in some ways, I still have to
get used to it. I hope I can also log in to the sites more easily next time
because today I had to go to them using the links in the inbox. Today we set up
ssh keys and learned how to clone the decidim repository. I also have to get
used to the three git commands: git add, git commit, git push.  

**July 9th:** This is my third day at PRIME. Today we are going to try to install Decidim so that next week we can start working on the software. The instructions to install Decidim was on a Zulip post. I hope that we can successfully install Decidim soon!

**July 12:** Today I worked on the Dogfood website after being made an admin. I made a process about the air conditioning in the cafe. There are also proposals and surveys that can be created on a process about the topic, and the process can be published when it's ready.

**July 13:** Today I worked on Dogfood and updated the process I made yesterday. I included a survey for mine and added more description to it. Next, I'm going to publish it so that the process is visible to others. This morning, we had a meeting about what we have done yesterday. The meeting took place in the freezer room when we first arrived to the cafe. After some technical difficulties, the computer connected to the television.

**July 14:** I am creating new components in Dogfood so that I can find out how each one works. The ones that I have tried so far are proposals, surveys, and blogs. I am still trying to figure out how exactly the website works and what it can do. Today we are going to have a meeting at 12:30 pm.
