# Marian's PRIME Program Journal

Welcome to Marian's PRIME journal!

**July 8th**: This is my second day at PRIME. I learned how to create and save
a file using vim commands. I also had the chance to explore BigBlueButton and
how to use it. I am starting to learn vim because last year I have worked with
nano instead. It is similar to nano but different in some ways, I still have to
get used to it. I hope I can also log in to the sites more easily next time
because today I had to go to them using the links in the inbox. Today we set up
ssh keys and learned how to clone the decidim repository. I also have to get
used to the three git commands: git add, git commit, git push.  

July 9th: This is my third day at PRIME. Today we are going to try to install Decidim so that next week we can start working on the software. The instructions to install Decidim was on a Zulip post. I hope that we can successfully install Decidim soon!
