# Marian's PRIME Program Journal

Welcome to Marian's prime journal!

**July 8th**: This is my second day at PRIME. I learned how to create and save
a file using vim commands. I also had the chance to explore BigBlueButton and
how to use it. I am starting to learn vim because last year I have worked with
nano instead. It is similar to nano but different in some ways, I still have to
get used to it. I hope I can also log in to the sites more easily next time
because today I had to go to them using the links in the inbox. Today we set up
ssh keys and learned how to clone the decidim repository. I also have to get
used to the three git commands: git add, git commit, git push.
