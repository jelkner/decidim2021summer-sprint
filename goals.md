# Goals for Summer Sprint 2021

During the month of July, four Summer interns will be working with NOVA Web
Development to investigate and evaluate Decidim as a possible platform for
which NOVA Web Development could offer support as a business offering.

The two framing questions are:

1. Does existing experience with Decidim in Barcelona and other deployments
   suggest it is an effective tool for the participatory governance it aims to
   support?
1. Assuming the answer to the first question is positive, can NOVA Web
   Development offer effective support for the platform in deployment,
   configuration, and user training that would make it attractive to
   municiple governments interested in participatory democracy?
