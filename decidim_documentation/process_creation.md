# Process Creation

## This will only work if you are an admin

1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select "Processes" on the far left
1. If you are making a single process, select "Processes". If you want to make a "Process Group" (which is a single space where multiple processes can exist) go [here](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/tree/main/decidim_documentation)
1. Tap "New Process"
1. Enter the title of your process, this will appear from the "Processes" page of the home screen and in large font at the top of your process' page
1. Enter the subtitle, which will appear beneath your title in a smaller font on your process' page
1. **Optional:** Enter the weight of this process, this changes the order processes will appear on the "Processes" page. The lower the weight, the closer to the top the process will appear. In all likelihood, leaving the weight at 0 will be the default for processes
1. Create a URL slug for your process, this is what will be added to the end of your website domain and can just be the title of your process or something similar
1. **Optional:** You can add a hashtag, this will appear next to your subtitle and will link to any time that hashtag had been used on Twitter in the past. This will also appear on your "Processes" page along with your title and short description
1. Give a short description of your process, this will look similar to a header above your full length description on your next step, so make it short and not too detailed. This will also appear on the "Processes" page beneath your title
1. Write your full length description, this will show up underneath your short description in a smaller font on the home page of your process
1. **Optional:** You can add an "Announcment", this will apppear above your short description in a special abnner to bring attention to it. Statements of motivation about your process could fit well here
1. **Optional:** Include start and end dates on your process, which will remove the process from the "Processes" page while the default "Active Processes" is selcted until it begins and it will stay there until it ends. These will also be displayed on the far right side of your process' home page
1. **Optional:** Add a home and banner image to your process. The home image will be displayed with your title, hashtag, and short description on the "Processes" page. The banner image will be shown behind your title, hashtag, and subtitle on your process' page
1. **Optional:** You can add metadata to your process. All this does is display anything you enter on the far right of your process' home page above the start and end date. Whatever you enter here does not actually prevent those outside of who you say participates from participating, it simply adds more useful information for any participants or viewers
1. **Optional:** Enabling and creating scopes allows participants and viewers to filter processes based on their scope. Click [here]() to learn how to create scopes
1. **Optional:** Organizational areas essentially have the same effect on processes as scopes. Click [here]() to learn how to creat organizational areas and understand the difference between scopes and areas
1. **Optional:** If your process is meant to be connected to an existing Process Group, you can select the process group you want this process to be found in
1. **Optional:** Making your process a "Private Space" means that others cannot participate in your process. In most cases, you will not want this option enabled
1. **Optional:** Selecting "Promoted" simply means that there will be a small icon indicating that your process is promoted on the home page
1. **Optional:** If your process is similar or based off of an existing process, you can select the similar process here. This is not visible to participants and viewers
1. **Optional:** You can allow for statistics to be shown on your page. This appears on the bottom of your process' home page and displays the number of participants, followers, proposals, supports, endorsements, meetings, answers, etc. if you have any of them
1. **Optional:** You can choose to show metrics as well, which is a link that is displayed beneath statitics. This link directs you to a page where you can download CSV files for all of the data collected by your process
1. Once you have finished all of these steps and are feeling good about your process, select create at the bottom of the screen. You can always go back and edit many of these configurations if you change your mind
1. You can select "View public page" to see what your process will look like once published
1. From here, you can either create "Components", "Phases", "Categories", etc. or you can publish your process as it is and you will be able to add any of these other features over time. Also, you will still be able to edit your process as a whole in "Info" once your process is published, you will just need to scroll to the bottom of the "Info" page and click "Update" each time you do

## Process Created!

Creating processes can be tedious at times, but being able to understand what each step of process configuration truly does should allow for a much smoother experience as a Decidim Admin.
