# Process Group Creation

## This will only work if you are an admin

1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select "Processes" on the far left
1. If you are making a process group, select "Process groups". If you want to make a "Process" (to make a singular process) go [here](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/process_creation.md)
1. Click "New process group" on the top right
1. Enter the title of your process group, this will appear from the "Processes" page of the home screen and in large font at the top of your process group's page
1. Enter a brief description for your process group. This will be shown beneath your title on the "Processes" page and at the top of your process group's page. If your description is too long, it will be cut off on the "Processes" page and look less professional
1. **Optional:** You can select existing processes that may have some relation to your process group
1. **Optional:** You can include an image that will be displayed on your process group's main page
1. **Optional:** You can add metadata to your process. All this does is display anything you enter on the far right of your process group's home page. Whatever you enter here does not actually prevent those outside of who you say participates from participating, it simply adds more useful information for any participants or viewers. The hashtage links directly to any use of that hashtag on Twitter and the website shows itself as a URL directing to the chosen site
1. **Optional:** Selecting "Promoted" in the Visibility section does not actually affect your process group, it simply displays to the user that your group happens to be promoted. It is a configuration that most people will never have to use, but you could play around with it out of curiousity if you'd like
1. Remember, the large majority of configurations on Decidim can be edited even after being published. Do not stress yourself about having all the configurations correct the first time
1. Once you have created your process group, you can control some amount of the UI using the "Landing page". I would suggest playing around with this some before publishing your process group to have it look exactly the way you want it to
1. Before your process group is published, you can select "View public page" to be able to see what it would look like when released
1. Once you feel ready, select "Info" on your process group's admin page. Scroll down to the bottom and select "Publish". Each time you make an edit on the "Info" page, make sure you scroll to the bottom and tap "Update"
1. Now you can create processes and connect them to this process group (instructions for doing so are found in step 3)
