# Assemblies:

## What are they?
Assemblies are very similar to a process, but they can be configured to change
permissions for specific users:
Type of Assembly | Who Can See | Who Can Participate
---------------- | ----------- | -------------------
Default | Everyone | Everyone
Transparent | Everyone | Specific Users
Private | Specific Users | Specific Users

In the default assembly, everyone can see what is happening and everyone can 
participate, by voting or creating proposals, or other actions. In a transparent
assembly, everyone can see what is happening but only specific users can
participate. These users are selected by the admins. Finally, in a private
assembly, only specific users can see and participate in assemblies. These users
are selected by admins. 

## How to Implement: 

* Enter the admin dashboard through the down arrow next to your username at the top right of the screen. 

* On the left side of the screen, click on "Assemblies"

* Click on "New Assembly"

* Fill out the information until "Visibility". 
	- If you want the default assembly, don't check any boxes in the
"Visibility" tab
	- If you want the transparent assembly, click "Private Space" and "Is 
Transparent"
	- If you want the private assembly, click "Private Space" only
* Most of the information in the form is just displayed as text on the website 
of the assembly, with the exception of the "Visibility" tab, so you should fill
it out if you would like but it's not always necessary. 
* Click "Create" to publish the assembly. If your assembly is private or
transparent, you must manually add users to the assembly to allow them to 
participate.
	- From the admin dashboard, click on "Assemblies" on the left of the
screen to bring you to a list of assemblies.
	- From there, click on the name of an assembly that you'd like to add
people to. 
	- On the left side of the screen, click on "Private Users". These are 
users who will be able to interact with the components of the assembly.
