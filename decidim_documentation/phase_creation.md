# Phase Creation

## This will only work if you are an admin

1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select "Processes" on the far left
1. Select the "Configuration" (pencil icon) button of the process you want to create a phase for
1. Select "Phases" on the left side of the screen
1. Regardless of whether or not you have made a phase prior, there will be a phase made already
	-If this is your first process, click the "Edit" (pencil icon) button where it says "Introduction"
	-If you want to make a new phase because you have already made a phase before, select "New phase" in the top right of your screen
1. Give your phase a title, this can be specific about the part of this process this phase will take place during or it can be as simple as "First", "Second", "Third", etc. The way you title your phases is up to you, but try to keep it consistent. Your title will be visible in the top right of your process' home page when you select this to be the current phase (I will explain that more later) and will be visible when you select "Process phases" from your process' home page
1. **Optional:** Though I would definitely suggest always including a description on your phases, but it technically is optional. This will be displayed along with the phase title on the "Process phases" screen
1. **Optional:** Start and End Dates help to be able to map out your process' plan. They are optional, but if they are applicable to your process, I would suggest doing it. It helps users to be able to see what they should be doing at any given moment while your process is active. These dates are displayed alongside your title on both the main process pages and on the "Process phases" screen
1. **Optional:** Call to Action path and text is a button that is displayed on the main process pages that can direct the user to whatever part of the process is related to the current phase. The text can be whatever you want, but try not to make it more than a few words. The path will be only the very end of the URL connected to the process componenet you want to direct people to. This is often something like "f/12/" and the full url is shown beneath this text box on the configuartion screen
