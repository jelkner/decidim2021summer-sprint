# Proposal Creation

**Part 1 will only work if you are an admin**

## Part 1: Creating the Component
1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select either ["Processes"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) or ["Assemblies"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) on the far left, depending on what you are making this proposal in
1. Select the process/assembly you wish to create this proposal in
1. Tap "Components" on the left side
1. Select the "Add component" drop down menu and choose "Proposals"
1. Give your proposals tab a name, whether you want to keep it as "Proposals" or make it slightly more relevant to your process or assembly. This will be displayed as a tab on your process'/assembly's page
1. **Optional:** You can add a weight to your proposals tab. This sets the order in which component tabs will appear on the process/assembly page. The lower the number, the closer to the left the componenet tab will be. If the order is irrelevant to your process/assembly, you can leave all component weights at 0
1. **Optional:** You can enable scopes and select the scope that your process'/assembly's proposals would fall into. This helps when participants are trying to filter every proposal on your site
1. **Optional:** You can place a support limit, minimum supports, and/or a proposal limit. The support limit means that participants can only support a certain numbe rof proposals. Minimum supports is the number of proposals each participant must support at the very least. Proposal limit is the number of proposals each participant is allowed to create. If all of these are set to 0, there is no limit/minimum in place
1. **Optional:** Setting a maximum proposal body length is the character limit for the descriptions of proposals
1. You have to choose between letting people edit their proposals for an infinite amount of time or for a set amount of time. The reason to not allow editing after a certain amount of time is that you would not want someone to change their proposal after people have already begun supporting that proposal or others
1. Threshold per proposal is the minimum number of supports a proposal must get before being accepted. Leaving the threshold at 0 means that the proposal can receive infinite supports and can be accepted at any time
1. **Optional:** You can select to allow proposals to receive supports beyond the threshold. **Only consider doing this if your threshold is greater than 0.** The reasonto not allow supports beyond the threshold is in case you want several proposals to be accepted and you have a support limit in place
1. **Optional:** You can select to have proposal answering enabled, official proposals enabled, comments enabled, geocoding enabled, attachments enabled, allow card image, actions permissions, collaborative drafts enabled, participatory texts enabled, and amendments enabled. Proposal answering allows for an admin to mark the proposal as being accepted, denied, or in the evaluation stage. Official proposals allow for admins to create proposals through the Admin Dashboard. Comments allow participants to make and like/dislike comments on proposals. Geocoding enabled displays a map on the proposals page that displays pinned locations of the places each proposal was created. Attachments enabled allows people to add files to their proposal. Allowing a card image lets those creating proposals add an image that is displayed alongside the title on the proposals page. Actions permissions being set for each proposal means that each proposal can have its own unique permissions. Collaborative drafts being enabled created a button that leads to another page where participants can work together to build ideas for proposals. **Do not enable participatory texts, it will make the UI of the proposals page very lackluster and will not show the button to allow participants to make proposals, even if proposal creating is enabled.** Amendments enabled allows particpants to essentially offer changes to a proposal that already exists. All of these except participatory texts can be changed after proposals have been made
1. **Optional:** You can create an announcement that will appear at the top of the proposals page in a special banner. Use this if there is something that you want to draw attention to
1. **Optional:** You can create a new proposal body template, new proposal help text, proposal wizard "Create" step help text, proposal wizard "Compare" step help text, roposal wizard "Complete" step help text, and/or proposal wizard "Publish" step help text. All these texts are displayed for participants making proposals from the proposals page and should be useful messages about what each step will look like, what they should be putting there, etc
1. **Optional:** You can choose to have endorsements enabled, endorsements blocked, supports enabled, supports blocked, supports hidden, comments blocked, proposal creation enabled, proposal answering enabled, proposal answers published immediately, costs on proposal answers enbaled. Endorsements allow for people to essentially "shoutout" a proposal on their Decidim profile, so whenever someone checks their profile, the proposal can be found. Typically there is no reason not to allow it. Supports are how people select the proposal(s) they agree with. Although I would strongly suggest keeping them enabled, hiding the count of supports could help to limit biases in people's supports. Blocking comments undoes what you presumably already enabled in step 15. **Proposal creation is important to enable if you want participants to be able to add proposals.** Publishing proposal answers immediately just shows how each proposal was answered the moment they are answered. Enabling costs on proposal answers allows the admin to include any cons or issues with the proposal.
1. If you are doing this within a process, the previous step can be repeated for each phase in your process. If you add another phase to the process, you will have to go back in to proposal configuration and edit these for the new phase
1. **Optional:** You can add an announcement which will appear in each phase similar to the announcement you had the option of making earlier
1. **Optional:** You can have hashtags automatically added to proposals being made or have them placed as a suggestion to the person making the proposal

## Part 2: Making Proposals

1. If you are an admin, you can select your proposals component from the Admin Dashboard and select "New proposal". If you are a participant, go to the proposals page inthe process or assembly you want to make it in and select "New proposal" on the left side of the screen
1. Give your proposal a proper title for what is actually being proposed
1. Provide a brief description of your proposal's purpose and what it would actually do as the body
1. **Optional:** If your proposal is based off ideas that were thrown around in a meeting, you can select which meeting it came from
1. Once you create your proposal and you are feeling good about it, you can publish it

## Proposal Created

Possibly one of the most finnicky aspects of Decidim administration, proposals are probably where documentation lacks the most. However, proposals are what allow Decidim to be so great and they create the participation in governance that Decidim was made for.
