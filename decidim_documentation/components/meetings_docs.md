# Meetings Creation

**Part 1 will only work if you are an admin**

## Part 1: Creating the Component
1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select either ["Processes"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) or ["Assemblies"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) on the far left, depending on what you are making this proposal in
1. Select the process/assembly you wish to create this meeting in
1. Tap "Components" on the left side
1. Select the "Add component" drop down menu and choose "Meetings"
1. Give your meetings tab a name, whether you want to keep it as "Meetings" or make it slightly more relevant to your process or assembly. This will be displayed as a tab on your process'/assembly's page
1. **Optional:** You can add a weight to your meetings tab. This sets the order in which component tabs will appear on the process/assembly page. The lower the number, the closer to the left the componenet tab will be. If the order is irrelevant to your process/assembly, you can leave all component weights at 0
1. **Optional:** You can enable scopes and select the scope that your process'/assembly's meetings would fall into. This helps when participants are trying to filter every meeting on your site
1. **Optional:** You can create an announcement that will appear at the top of the meetings page in a special banner. Use this if there is something that you want to draw attention to
1. **Optional:** You can add default registraion terms, which is a basic set of terms and services that appears as people register for meetings. Could be something like "This meeting will be recorded" or something like that which they would be agreeing to
1. **Optional:** You can choose to enable comments on meetings, which will create a comment section on the bottom of each meetings' page. You can alse set a character limit for comments or just leave it at 0 and have it at the default value of 1000.
1. **Optional:** You can choose to enable registration codes, which limits who can register for the meeting. Decidim does not help you through the process of making registration codes at all, so I would suggest either enabling them but not worrying about using them or simply disabling them for your meetings
1. **Optional:** You can set it so actions permissions can be set for each meeting, which means that each individual meeting created can have specific permissions rather than the defaults
1. **Optional:** You can enable pads creating, which requires a previous Ether-pad integration that you have already configurated. In other words, it will not affect your meetings negatively to have it on, but typically there is no point
1. **Optional:** You can choose whether you want participants to be able to make meetings or not. This is probably the most important part of all of the optional configurations of meetings. If you only want admins to be able to make meetings and you want to be able to control the specific meetings that are being displayed, keep this disabled. If you want to allow participants to make meetings, even if they are only the selected private participants of an assembly, then enable this.
1. **Optional:** If you are making this meetings component in a process, you can choose to block comments and to have a different announcement for each phase. Assemblies can do this in "Default step settings" which just become the active configuration
1. Select "Add component" at the bottom
1. Go to the "Components" page of your process/assembly on the Admin Dashboard and click the check mark next to your proposal component to publish it
1. Remember that many of these configurations can be changed even after being published

## Part 2: Making Meetings

1. If you are an admin, you can select your meetings component from the Admin Dashboard and select "New meeting". If you are a participant, go to the meetings page inthe process or assembly you want to make it in and select "New meeting" on the left side of the screen
1. Give a title to your meeting that relates to what the meeting will be about
1. Give a brief description of the meeting's purpose and what will happen during the meeting
1. Select whether your meeting is online, in person, or both. If you select online or both, an option to paste the meeting link will appear to allow participants to access the meeting through Decidim. If it is in person or both, it will prompt you to enter the address for your meeting, a map showing the location of this meeting will appear on your meeting page
1. Add a start and end time to your meeting which will be shown on your meeting page
1. **Optional:** If you have worked with categories before and you have one that relates to this meeting, you can select which category this meeting falls into
1. Select how you want registration for your meeting to work. You can disable registrations, have people register through Decidim and set a registration limit, or direct them to a different site to register
1. **Optional:** You can choose to make the meeting private and not visible for all members. You can also select to make the meeting transparent while it's private and have it visible to all, but only private participants can participate in it
1. **Optional:** If you have experience with services, you can use them. However, I would suggest ignoring them
1. Select "Create" at the bottom
