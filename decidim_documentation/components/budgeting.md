# Budgets Creation

**This will only work if you are an admin**

## Part 1: Creating the Component

1. Access the Admin Dashboard
1. Select either ["Processes"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) or ["Assemblies"](https://github.com/jelkner/decidim2021summer-sprint/blob/main/decidim_documentation/assemblies_docs.md) on the far left, depending on what you are making this budget in
1. Select the process/assembly you wish to create this budget in
1. Tap "Components" on the left side
1. Select the "Add component" drop down menu and choose "Budgets"
1. Give your proposals tab a name, whether you want to keep it as "Budgets" or make it slightly more relevant to your process or assembly. This will be displayed as a tab on your process'/assembly's page
1. **Optional:** You can add a weight to your budgets tab. This sets the order in which component tabs will appear on the process/assembly page. The lower the number, the closer to the left the componenet tab will be. If the order is irrelevant to your process/assembly, you can leave all component weights at 0
1. **Optional:** You can enable scopes and select the scope that your process'/assembly's budgeting projects would fall into. This helps when participants are trying to filter every budgeting project on your site
1. You can select to either have each participant be allowed to vote on only one budgeting project in total or allow them to vote for as many as they would like
1. You can set the number of projects that will be displayed per page. Unless you have an issue of having too many budgeting projects, it is best to leave it at the default of 12
1. **Optional:** You can enable a minimum budget percentage, which means that a budgeting project cannot be passed unless it has or surpasses a certain percentage of the total vote
1. **Optional:** 
1. **Optional:** You can choose to enable comments, which creates a comment section beneath your budget projects. You can also set a character limit for commentsor leave it at 0 for the default of 1000
1. **Optional:** You can choose to low actions permissions to be set for each project, which means the creator of a project is able to make the permissions on it unique
1. **Optional:** You can create an announcement that will appear at the top of the budgets page in a special banner. Use this if there is something that you want to draw attention to
1. **Optional:** 
1. **Optional:** You can choose to put text in the more information modal, which will appear on your budgets page through a button labeled "More information"
1. **Optional:** If you are making this budget in a process, you can select whether or not you want comments to be blocks, whether or not you want participants to be able to vote, if voting is finished, whether or not to display the vote count, and have the announcement, landing page, and more information modal change for each process. If you are making this in an assembly, you can do the same for the default step settings
1. Select "Add component" at the bottom
1. Go to the "Components" page of your process/assembly on the Admin Dashboard and click the check mark next to your proposal component to publish it
